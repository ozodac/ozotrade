## 📈 **Strategy Details:**

Momentum: 0.15%
Expected: 15-30 trades/month
Best for: Real trading
Risk: Lower
```

### **Aggressive (Active):**
```
Momentum: 0.10%
Expected: 30-50 trades/month
Best for: Testing, slow markets
Risk: Moderate
```

### **Dual Symbol:**
```
Trades: SPY + SPX simultaneously
Balance: $50k each ($100k total)
Expected: 30-60 trades/month combined

```

## ⚙️ **Using the Platform:**

### **First Time:**
1. Open: `https://ozodac.github.io/ozotrade/`
2. Choose strategy (click any card)
3. Click "▶ Start Trading"
4. Watch it trade automatically!

### **Optional Settings:**

- Adjust risk/targets

### **Switching Strategies:**
- Click "← Change Strategy"

---

## 🔄 **Dual Symbol Mode:**

**How It Works:**
- Runs two independent algorithms
- SPY algorithm trades SPY
- SPX algorithm trades SPX
- Both can be in trades simultaneously
- Combined performance tracking

**Example:**
```
10:30 AM: SPY hits 0.15% momentum → Buys SPY CALL
10:35 AM: SPX hits 0.15% momentum → Buys SPX CALL
10:40 AM: SPY hits profit target → Closes +$500
10:45 AM: SPX still in trade...
10:50 AM: SPX hits profit target → Closes +$750

Total: $1,250 from both trades!
```

---

## 📊 **Performance Tracking:**

### **Single Symbol Modes:**
- Balance
- Total P&L
- Current price
- Win rate
- Active position
- Trade history

### **Dual Symbol Mode:**
- Combined balance
- Combined P&L
- Total trades (SPY + SPX)
- Combined win rate
- Two separate sections showing each symbol
- Unified trade history
